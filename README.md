zrecommerce-storefront-php
==========================

ZRECommerce store front (eCommerce) application stack that consumes the zrecore-js REST service. This is the PHP implementation.

The zrecommerce-storefront-php repository contains only the PHP class library, so you can interact with the RESTful zrecore-js backend as you see fit.

For a full application stack written in PHP, use one of the following:

* zrecommerce-storefront-wordpress WordPress plugin for the storefront application stack.
* zrecommerce-storefront-symfony2 Symfony 2.x storefront library package.
* zrecommcere-storefront-zf2 Zend Framework 2.x storefront library package.


We also have a zrecommerce-storefront setup for the following:

* zrecommerce-storefront-python Python based storefront library.
* zrecommerce-storefront-django Django based application stack
* zrecommerce-storefront-ror Ruby on Rails based application stack
* zrecommerce-storefront-scala Scala based storefront library.
* zrecommerce-storefront-js A Node.js based storefront library.
